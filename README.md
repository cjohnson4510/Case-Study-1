# Case-Study-1
Beer and Breweries Case Study by James Weaver & Chris Johnson
# Introduction
Budweiser tasked us with answering questions regarding US beers and breweries.  Budweiser gave us two data sets; one containing the data of 558 breweries and another containing the data of 2410 beers.

The data contained all relevant information needed to answer the proposed questions.  Some of the data included were brewery location, ABV, IBU and style of Beer.

We were able to to clean, prep, merge, transform and visualize the data to appropriately answer all questions from Budweiser.

# Files
Data contains the .csv files used in the data analysis

Brew.Rmd is an Rmarkdown file containing the code as well as anwers to the questions

# Conclusion
States varied greatly with the number of breweries they contained.  Multiple states only had 1 brewery while Colorado had the most at 47.
When searching through the missing data IBU had significantly more missing data than ABV.  This could be do to ABV being a more well known measurement of beer than IBU, thus deemed more important.
There was evidence to suggest that a higher ABV had a correlation with higher IBU, these beers usually were IPAs
Using are KNN model we were able to find different accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for identifying different types of beers.
Overall, higher ABV and IBU IPA's in states with the highest number of breweries , CO and CA, would likely lead to the success of a new craft brewery from Budweiser.
