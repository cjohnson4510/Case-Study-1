# Case-Study-1
Beer and Breweries Case Study by James Weaver & Chris Johnson
# Introduction
Budweiser tasked us with answering questions regarding US beers and breweries.  Budweiser gave us two data sets; one containing the data of 558 breweries and another containing the data of 2410 beers.

The data contained all relevant information needed to answer the proposed questions.  Some of the data included were brewery location, ABV, IBU and style of Beer.

We were able to to clean, prep, merge, transform and visualize the data to appropriately answer all questions from Budweiser.
